# BRHSegmentedControl

Swift package with a SwiftUI control that mimics the SwiftUI Picker using the segmented style.

Replicates the behavior of the native control:

* Drag the selected segment to change value
* Touch on an unselected segment to change value
* Cancel a touch by dragging away vertically from the segment

Visually, the replication is not exact, but it is IMO close. In particular:

* Touching on the selected segment shrinks the indicator by a small amount
* Touching on an unselected segment grays the text of the touched segment
* Segment dividers adjacent to the selected segment disappear
* All interface changes are animated just like the native control

Additional features:

* Honors the `accentColor` color out of the box (unlike the native control)
* Easy to create 1-based numeric segments - `.init(selectedIndex: $selected, count: 4)`
* Easy to create segments using text labels - `.init(selectedIndex: $selected, ["One", "Two", "Buckle", "Shoe"])`
* Segments can have their own custom views by providing your own `@ViewBuilder` method
* Supports custom styling of the segment view's foreground via your own `ShapeStyle` method
* Supports disabling animations via custom view modifier `disableAnimations`

# Using

Simply add the `brh-segment-control` package to your `Package.swift` file or add via Xcode.

```
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/bradhowes/brh-segmented-control", from: "1.0.0"),
  ],
...
  .target(
    name: "MyView",
    dependencies: [
      .product(name: "BRHSegmentedControl", package: "brh-segmented-control")
    ]
  ),
```

For examples of how to use, see the `PreviewContent` struct in [BRHSegmentedControl.swift][bsc]. There are also the 
unit tests that exercise the API which show additional examples.

The default view builder methods are in [BRHSegmentedControlSupport.swift][bscs]. Creating custom ones
is easy and offers greater control of segment content. There are two versions, one taking one `Int` argument, and
another that takes an `Int` and a `String`. The second one is required when you provide a collection of strings in the
`init` method. The first argument is the segment's index to generate, and the second argument is the value from the
collection given in the `init`.

# Limitation on macOS

The control will switch selections when clicked on, but currently there is no visible change in appearance when the 
click takes place. This can be fixed with some minor effort.

# Credits

I wrote all of the code in this repository with the exception of the `Color` extension to allow for light/dark color
selecting in code. That comes courtesy of [Jesse Squires's][js] [blog post][bp]. In my own AUv3 project I first started 
to use [CustomizableSegmentedControl][csc] by [Tyoma Zagoskin][tz], but I then decided to try and replicate Apple's 
implementation and so here we are. Finally, [this post][so] on StackOverflow by [Benzy Neez][bn] helped me wire up 
the `DragGesture` correctly to handle drag interactions with the segment. It was truly the missing piece that magically 
brought everything together where I could at least mimic if not fully replicate the little details in Apple's 
implementation.
